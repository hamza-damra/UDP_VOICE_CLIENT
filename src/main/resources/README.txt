Voice Call Application Resources

This directory contains resources for the Voice Call Application.

For the icon file (icon.ico), you can:
1. Create your own 32x32 or 64x64 pixel icon
2. Use an online ICO converter to convert PNG/JPG to ICO format
3. Or use the default system icon if no custom icon is provided

The MSI installer will use these resources during installation.
